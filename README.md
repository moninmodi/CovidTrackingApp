# CovidTrackingApp. 
This project demonstrates how to fetch data using API in Nodejs. I have extended it by adding HTML and CSS.  The main aim of this project to fetch the number of covid cases and number of deaths in a particular country.
For the frontend I have used HTML and CSS. For fetching the data I have used nodejs as a backend. 
Tha api used for retrieving the data is "https://corona.lmao.ninja/v2/countries/india".
